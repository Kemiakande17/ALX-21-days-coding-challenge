Object file is different from the source file. the source file is the code written by the pogrammer, while the object file is after the code has been compiled
exercise_2.c: This program allows the user to input a radius and then calculates the area of a CIRCLE.
exercise_3.c: This program prints out 'X' in 10 times after giving a space of 10 line
exercise_4.c: line 4 developes an error message, which prevented the programe from compiling. The semicolon on line 4 ought not to be there and the programme compiled immediately it was removed
exercise_5.c: in line 6, 'do_it' cannot be used to output any statement, therefore the programme couldn't compile.
exercise_6.c: the modification to exercise 3 to line 9 made a print out of 10 blank lines
my print and run didnt compile
The format the pdf book uses doesn't comply with betty style, so from day2, I would do the exercises/ write ttheir codes in a way it would comply with betty style
Sumarrily, in day 1, I learnt how to use printf to print out blank lines
